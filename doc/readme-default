1. Target board for this firmware

    This firmware is made for the System Management
    Controller of the Commander X16 official board
    that is sold through texelec.com and for Joe 
    Burk's (a.k.a. Wavicle) OtterX board.

    It is not recommended to use this firmware with
    any other board. Doing so may break your system,
    requiring the SMC to be programmed with an external
    programmer.

2.  The SMCUPDATE-x.x.x.PRG file

    This is an update program that runs on the
    X16. The SMC firmware is embedded into the
    file. Just run it and follow the on-screen
    instructions.

    This is the recommended tool for updating the 
    SMC firmware.

3.  The SMC-x.x.x.BIN file

    This file contains the firmware in binary format. A header
    is embedded in the file before the actual firmware,
    needed if you program the SMC with this tool:

    https://github.com/FlightControl-User/x16-flash

    Please note that the file can't be used to program
    the SMC with an external programmer due to 
    the header.

4.  The firmware_with_bootloader.hex file

    This file contains the firmware and a bootloader
    that makes it possible to update the SMC from the
    X16.

    The bootloader source code is available here:

    https://github.com/X16Community/x16-smc-bootloader

    This file can be used to program the SMC with
    an external programmer.

5. The x16-smc.ino.hex file

    This file contains the firmare in Intel HEX format.
    
    This file can be used to program the SMC with
    an external programmer.
    
    Please note that it does not contain a bootloader.
